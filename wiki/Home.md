# sci_paper_llm — Local Paper Research Assistant

Build a dataset of **open-access** scientific papers from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org), download their full text, and ask questions about them with a **local LLM** ([Ollama](https://ollama.com)) — all on your own machine.

Each paper becomes a row with: `authors, title, content, date, country, journal, theme`. A small web UI lets you search a topic, watch the download progress, and query the corpus in natural language with cited answers.

## Why it exists

Most tools that "get papers in bulk" rely on piracy. This project deliberately uses **OpenAlex** (a free, open index of ~250M scholarly works) and only ever downloads PDFs from the **legal open-access locations** OpenAlex points to. The result is a clean, reproducible corpus you can analyse or feed to an LLM.
